PCA Steps
1. Standardize the data.
2. Use the standardized data to create a covariance matrix.
3. Use the resulting matrix to calculate eigenvectors (principal components) and 
	their corresponding eigenvalues.
4. Sort the components in decending order by its eigenvalue.
5. Choose n components which explain the most variance within the 
	data (larger eigenvalue means the feature explains more variance).
6. Create a new matrix using the n components.
